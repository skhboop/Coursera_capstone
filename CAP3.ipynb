    "The data comes from collision and accident reports in Seattle during the years 2004-present. It was collected by the Seattle Police Department and Traffic Records department. The data will be used to identify the key variables that cause accidents. For example, the “WEATHER” column can be used to show the types and number of accidents that occur for different categories. In addition, the “INTKEY” column can be grouped and the sum of the accidents in that intersection can be calculated. This list can be sorted descending to identify the more dangerous intersections that need improvements or closer monitoring. Finally, a supervised learning model will be used to come up with a formula that can predict the severity of an accident based on the inputs.\n",
    "The data has 37 independent variables and 194,673 records. The dependent variable, “SEVERITYCODE”, has numbers that correspond to different levels of severity caused by the accident. Many of the columns are object types. In addition, other columns that appear to be integer types are also actually objects, because the numbers correspond to different categories. Finally, some columns and rows have null values, which will be dealt with during the data pre-processing phase."

    "Exploratory data analysis was performed on the relevant categorical variables: address type, collision type, person count, pedestrian count, cyclist count, vehicle count, junction type, SDOT type, under the influence, weather, road conditions, light conditions, lane key, crosswalk key, and if a parked car was hit. The amount of categories in each variable ranged from a few to over a dozen. As a result, categories with less than a dozen variables were turned into countplots to better visualize the data. Statistical testing was not performed because the data revolved around categorical variables, not numerical ones.\n",
    "Unfortunately, key variables such as pedestrian right of way, inattentive drivers, and whether the car was speeding had a majority of null values. Therefore, they were dropped and not part of the analysis. However, it is likely that these variables play a key factor in vehicle accidents."
